		<h1>Flowers photos</h1>
		<p>Flowers come in many different colors, smells, shapes, and sizes. They need food and sunlight to survive, as they make their own food/energy through photosynthesis. Some flowers are carnivorous and trap insects to digest them, and some flowers are used as natural insecticides. Flowers are also thermogenic and can generate heat to attract pollinators.</p>
